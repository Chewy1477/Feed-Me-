# Feed-Me-

The idea of Feed Me is to have pay it forward crowdfunding to pre-purchase meals for those who need it. My app uses Parse with Heroku as a backend and Braintree v.zero for payment processing. To implement Braintree v.zero, I created a live backend server to handle requests using Node.js and Heroku, with the Express.js framework middleware.
