# Feed-Me-
#FirstApp

The idea of Feed Me is to have pay it forward crowdfunding coupled with a geolocation service (to be implemented) to pre-purchase meals
for the hungry. My app uses Parse with Heroku as a backend and Braintree v.zero for payment processing. To implement Braintree v.zero, 
I created a live backend server to handle requests using Node.js and Heroku, with the Express.js framework middleware.
